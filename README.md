# VSDiagnostics
A collection of code-quality analyzers based on the new Roslyn platform. This project aims to ensure code-quality as you type it in your editor rather than having to do this as a separate build-step. Likewise it also tries to help avoid some common pitfalls.

## What is an analyzer exactly?

> With the release of Visual Studio 2015 RC, we also received the pretty much final implementation of the Diagnostics implementation. This SDK allows us to create our own diagnostics to help us write proper code that’s being verified against those rules in real-time: you don’t have to perform the verification at a separate build-step. What’s more is that we can combine that with a code fix: a shortcut integrated in Visual Studio that provides us a solution to what we determine to be a problem.

> This might sound a little abstract but if you’ve been using Visual Studio (and/or Resharper) then you know what I mean: have you ever written your classname as class rather than Class? This is a violation of the C# naming conventions and visual studio will warn you about it and provide you a quickfix to turn it into a proper capitalized word. This is exactly the behaviour we can create and which is integrated seemlessly in Visual Studio.

## What is available?

Currently these diagnostics are implemented:

| Category | Name | Description | Analyzer | Code Fix |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Exceptions | EmptyArgumentException | Guards against using an `ArgumentException` without specifying which argument. | Yes  | No  |
| Exceptions   | SingleGeneralException  | Guards against using a catch-all clause.  | Yes  | No   |
| Exceptions  | CatchNullReferenceException  | Guards against catching a NullReferenceException.  | Yes   | No   |
| Exceptions | ArgumentExceptionWithNameofOperator | `ArgumentException` and its subclasses should use `nameof()` when they refer to a method parameter. | Yes | Yes |
| Exceptions | RethrowExceptionWithoutLosingStacktrace | Warns when an exception is rethrown in a way that it loses the stacktrace. | Yes | Yes |
| Exceptions | EmptyCatchClause | Warns when an exception catch block is empty. | Yes | No |
| Async | AsyncMethodWithoutAsyncSuffix | Asynchronous methods should end with -Async. | Yes | Yes |
| Strings | ReplaceEmptyStringWithStringDotEmpty | Use `string.Empty` instead of `""`. | Yes | Yes |
| Tests | TestMethodWithoutPublicModifier | Change the access modifier to `public` for all methods annotated as test. Supports NUnit, MSTest and xUnit.net. | Yes | Yes |
| General | NullableToShorthand | Changes `Nullable<T>` to `T?`. | Yes | Yes |
| General | IfStatementWithoutBraces | Changes one-liner `if` and `else` statements to be surrounded in a block. | Yes | Yes |
| General | ConditionalOperatorReturnsDefaultOptions | The conditional operator shouldn't return redundant `true` and `false` literals. | Yes | Yes |
| General | CompareBooleanToTrueLiteral | A boolean expression doesn't have to be compared to true. | Yes | Yes |
| General | TypeToVar | Use `var` instead of an explicit type. | Yes | Yes |
| General | OnPropertyChangedWithoutNameOfOperator | Use the `nameof()` operator in conjunction with `OnPropertyChanged` | Yes | Yes |
| General | SimplifyExpressionBodiedMember | Simplify the expression using an expression-bodied member. | Yes | Yes |
| General | TryCastWithoutUsingAsNotNull | A conversion can be done using `as` + a `null` comparison. | Yes | Yes |
| General | NamingConventions | Implements the most common configuration of naming conventions. | Yes |Yes |
| General | NonEncapsulatedOrMutableField | A `public`, `internal` or `protected internal` non-`const`, non-`readonly` field should be used as a property. | Yes | Yes |

## How do I use this?

Simply head over to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VSDiagnostics/) and install it! If you don't immediately find it: make sure you're also looking through the NuGet V2 package source.

## Can I request diagnostics?

Yes, you can! Create an issue and we'll take a look at your proposal. 

## What if I don't like a diagnostic?

Every diagnostic can be turned off for a single line or for the entire project. At most, you will have to ignore the diagnostic once. For this reason every diagnostic is turned on by default.

## Can I contribute?

Definitely! Take a look at the open issues and see if there's anything that interests you. Submit your pull request and we'll take a look at it as soon as possible.

If you think you're going to make larger changes than a single implementation then we would ask you to get in contact with us first so we can discuss it and prevent unneeded work.

You'll need the [Visual Studio 2015 Release Candidate](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx) and [the SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46850) to get started.
